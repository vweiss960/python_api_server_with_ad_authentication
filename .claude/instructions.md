- Always ask the User before creating any markdown documents
- Keep the documentation documents to a minimum. 
- When the user asks a question be consise with your answers and not overly verbose provide follow up options for the user to persue
- Whenever features are added to the code:
    - Try to test the new feature 
        - The current repo should be set up to test AD related authentication, so test AD related authentication!!
        - Make new testing scripts/functions (preferably python) to the tests folder in the project folder
    - Ask the user if new documentation should be generated for the new feature of it current documentation should be updated
    - If the tests are successful, add specific files that shouldn't be added to version control to the .gitignor file and commit the code with a detailed message for what was changed/updated.
